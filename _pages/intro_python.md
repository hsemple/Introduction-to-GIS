Python programming in GIS works by using the Python language to manipulate spatial objects contained in the large number of Python-based GIS libraries that available. 

As a beginner, you must first learn basic Python programming concepts.  Afterwards, use this knowledge to work with Python GIS libraries to accomplish specific GIS tasks.  Below, I list some of the basic Python concepts that must be first mastered before you can work successfully with the GIS libraries.  

<ul>
<li> What is Python? </li>
<li> Downloading and installing Python. Download <a href = "https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda Distribution</a> </li>
<li> Variables and variable assignment.   <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj3Uopm6XvY"> YouTube Video</a>.</li>
<li> Data types - strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries </li>
<li> String formatting </li>
<li> Casting </li>
<li> Modules, Standard and third-party libraries  </li>
<li> Creating and running simple programs </li>
<li>	Conditional statements </li>
<li>  While Loops, For Loops  </li>
<li>  Functions  </li>
<li>  File handling  </li>
<li>  Plotting graphs using Matplotlib, Pandas, etc  </li>
